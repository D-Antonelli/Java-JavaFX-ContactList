 ### Why I am building this project? :thinking:
 This is actually a challenge from Tim Buchalka's [Java Programming Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/). This challenge simply requires implementing a user interface for managing a contact list using JavaFX, as well as adding some functionality to add, delete, edit contacts. At the moment I have already finished given tasks, but I aim at implementing more extra functionalities and improve UI layout.
 ### Built With
